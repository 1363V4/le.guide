title: death after death
layout: post
---

a tiny white filter feeder

a steady stream of clear water

a fine shell sand forms in the cave

wave after wave

---

and so after every toll

every soul filters the soil

the tainted children misbehave

grave after grave

---

all pity the carrion bird

who flew above the wasted word!

the husked band follows the strum

crumb after crumb

---

i'm in a womb i cut a rug

i snap my tiny finger slug

unaware of the tryst of pain

strain after strain

---

i find my love in my own nest

and in that love solace and rest

fleeting whispers of fleeting breath

death after death
