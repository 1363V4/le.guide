j'aime bien la justification du 1 :
*ils vous trahiront encore juste pour prouver qu'ils avaient raison la première fois*.

mais c'est pas vraiment [tit for tat strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM).

bref, la question, essentielle, du pardon.

en ce moment je lis des [papiers de blog](https://longform.asmartbear.com/) sur l'entrepreneuriat.

alors faisons un petit essai de [réécriture ia](/2024/03/14/wagon_bar) :

`Here's the formatted version in markdown with added emphasis:`

## 1. Never give traitors a second chance

In the fast-paced world of startups, **trust is paramount**. When someone betrays that trust, whether it's an employee leaking confidential information or a co-founder going behind your back, the damage is often irreparable. Airbnb's early days were nearly derailed by a roommate who tried to hijack the business. The founders' swift action to cut ties likely saved the company. Remember, in a startup, you're building more than just a product - you're building a team and a culture. *Traitors poison both*.

## 2. Always take care of your employees' personal lives

This isn't about being nosy; it's about understanding that your team members are *whole people*, not just workers. When Gravity Payments' CEO Dan Price raised the minimum salary to $70,000, he wasn't just boosting morale - he was enabling his employees to have better personal lives, which in turn made them more productive and loyal. Smart founders know that a team that's stressed about rent or unable to afford childcare won't be able to give their all to the startup.

## 3. When you try to do everything at once, you end up doing nothing

**Focus is the lifeblood of startups**. The graveyard of failed companies is filled with those that tried to be everything to everyone. Look at Google: they started with one thing - search - and did it exceptionally well before branching out. Contrast this with companies like Quibi, which tried to revolutionize multiple aspects of content creation and delivery simultaneously, only to shut down within months. *Pick your battles, and fight them one at a time*.

## 4. Nothing is ever certain, especially when everything seems to be going well

Success can breed complacency, which is deadly for startups. Blackberry's fall from grace is a stark reminder of this. At their peak, they dominated the smartphone market, but they grew overconfident and failed to innovate. **Always be paranoid, always be looking for the next challenge or disruption**. The moment you think you've "made it" is the moment you start to lose.

## 5. The boss's enemy is ego

Ego blinds you to reality and makes you resistant to crucial feedback. Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos is a cautionary tale of how unchecked ego can lead to spectacular failure. On the flip side, look at Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn. He's known for his intellectual humility and willingness to learn from others, which has been key to his success. As a founder, *your job is to make the best decisions for your company, not to be the smartest person in the room*.

## 6. Fire the flatterers

Yes-men are toxic to a startup's culture and decision-making process. They create an echo chamber that can lead to disastrous choices. Steve Jobs, in his second stint at Apple, was known for surrounding himself with people who weren't afraid to disagree with him. This led to some of the most innovative products in tech history. **Cultivate a culture where dissent is not just tolerated, but encouraged**. The ability to have honest, sometimes uncomfortable conversations is a competitive advantage.

## 7. Conceal your profits

This isn't about dishonesty, but strategic opacity. In the early days of Amazon, Jeff Bezos was famously secretive about the company's financials. This served two purposes: it kept competitors guessing, and it allowed Amazon to reinvest heavily in growth without shareholder pressure for dividends. Of course, once you're public, this changes. But in the startup phase, *keeping your cards close to your chest can give you a crucial edge*.

## 8. There's always someone waiting for you somewhere

This speaks to the importance of networking and building relationships in the startup world. You never know where your next investor, co-founder, or crucial hire might come from. Reid Hoffman, again, is a master at this. His network has been key to his success across multiple ventures. But remember, **networking isn't about collecting business cards - it's about building genuine relationships** that can withstand the pressures of the startup world.

## 9. The customer is king

This might seem obvious, but it's amazing how many startups forget it. They get caught up in their vision or technology and lose sight of what the customer actually wants or needs. Zappos built an empire on this principle, with their fanatical devotion to customer service. Your product doesn't have to be perfect, but *your commitment to your customers should be*. They're not just users; they're your partners in building and refining your product.

## 10. Those who are talked about are never happy, no matter what is said

Public attention is a double-edged sword for startups. Media coverage can bring valuable exposure, but it also brings scrutiny and criticism. Mark Zuckerberg's journey with Facebook is a prime example. The more successful Facebook became, the more it (and he) became a target for criticism. As a founder, **develop a thick skin and a clear sense of purpose**. Use feedback constructively, but don't let it derail you. Your north star should be your mission and your customers, not public opinion.

`pas mal non ? c'est ricain.`

bon il se plante sur la 8 et la 10 mais c'est normal, il avait pas les refs.

et si je lui donne ?

`Here are the rewritten versions for points 8 and 10:`

## 8. There's always someone waiting for you somewhere

In the whirlwind of startup life, it's easy to forget that **your worth isn't measured by your company's valuation**. Your family, friends, and loved ones - the people who care about you regardless of your business success - are your true north. Steve Jobs, despite his legendary status, expressed regret for not spending more time with his children. Don't make the same mistake. Build your company, but not at the expense of the relationships that truly matter. *On your deathbed, you won't be thinking about your Series A funding*. You'll be thinking about the people you love and the moments you shared. Make sure those moments exist.

## 10. Those who are talked about are never happy, no matter what is said

Media coverage is a fickle beast, and startup founders often learn this the hard way. Even the most glowing praise can be dissected and found wanting by its subject. Elon Musk, despite often favorable coverage, frequently spars with journalists over perceived slights. The lesson? **Don't waste energy trying to control the narrative**. Instead, embrace the Streisand effect: the more you try to suppress or control information, the more interest it generates. So when it comes to media coverage, *go big or go home*. Let critics criticize. Let praise be lavish. Your energy is better spent building your product and serving your customers than obsessing over every word written about you. Remember, *there's no such thing as bad publicity* - except your own obituary.

bah bah bah.

ouais, rao avait raison. quel génie.

ça soulage.
