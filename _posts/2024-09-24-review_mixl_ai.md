site review.

i'll focus on how you convey your core values.

design:

- the site is too cluttered.
which is paradoxical for a focus tool.
take a look at [zenwriter](https://zenwriter.app/).
- clutter mostly comes from the carousel and video at the bottom.
they look like the annoying notifications you're trying to remove.
lack of coherence.
- social icons on the right...
from the same social which are the known
main source of distractions and interruptions.
- global typography and colors feels like a content company
(like netflix). bold letters, neon colors, dark bg.
unfortunate.

content:
- win back your time: from what? the subline
"multiply each hour with the project copilot trusted by tech teams everywhere."
doesn't really add much.
- additionally, copilot and ai are already strongly connoted.
don't use this term, you're not winning it back.
- "try for free" makes me look for a nonexistent pricing page.
"try it now" is a better call to action.
- ai optimized pomodoro timer feels like a meme.
distracts from day planner, which might be your good core value.
- speaking of the planner, what calendar?
the google icon in the call to action suggests google calendar.
what if i use outlook?
maybe it works, but your visitors are already drowning in questions.
- distracted every 4m? months? minutes? megas?
- brain music? that's called lo-fi. sounds like a meme again.
binaural waves as well.
- join a focus community: sounds great but what's that?
and what do i get?
whatsapp and discord: pick one.
nobody wants to join the side channel.
- same for your socials.
by the way, the distraction blocker panel shows
snap and insta icons.
once again, i agree these are great distraction sources...
from your phone.

extension page:

- i click the call to action and get the chrome extension page.
- still unclear what the pricing is.
- explanatory video as the first image is bad.
it gives "complicated saas tool" vibes.
i need a x-minutes video walkthrough to set up an ai pomodoro timer?
get cleaner visuals, like mobile app ones.
- not enough reviews.
- some people like me (what %?) are touchy about
what extensions they add to their browser.
this one is not making the cut.

closing thoughts:

- dot ai names are expensive.
"mixl" doesn't immediately ring a bell, to me at least.
your main focus should be linking the name to your product,
like [suno](/_posts/2024-09-23-suno.md).
- and in doing that,
finding your true added value.
