title: my nÂ°1 programming tip

i recently read an article titled "my top 1 programming tip ever".

it was shit. here's mine:

> carve your data

let me explain.
i often write code like this:

````python
def read_excel(excel):
    data = pandas.read_excel(excel)
    data = data.to_dict()
    data = [datum['x'] for datum in data if datum['y'] == 42]
    return data
```

i know. it's a cardinal sin. 
data is a dataframe, then a dict, then a list of "stuff".

it breaks the first commandment of:

> thou shalt have variables that behave predictably

> and thou shalt not reuse them

> wtf art thou doing?

but compare this to the alternative.

````python
def read_excel(excel):
    df = pandas.read_excel(excel)
    dict_data = df.to_dict()
    filtered_data = [datum['x'] for datum in dict_data if datum['y'] == 42]
    return filtered_data
```

there is a difference.

anyone reading the first code will understand:
*i want my data in a certain way, and i will not rest until i get it.*

i call that **carving data**.

and it matters a lot.
i spend a lot of time doing this.
but the logic flows effortlessly afterwards.

carve it.

now.
