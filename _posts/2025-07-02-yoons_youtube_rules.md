title: yoons' youtube rules
layout: post

if you're going to make videos,
you need to think about **2 things**:
- what you're going to say
- how you're gonna say it

for me, the "what" was easy,
i got passionnate about a thing (datastar)
and wanted to talk about it.

but the **how**?
how do you make a good video?

french youtuber "yoons" made
[a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plq4iZYx1o8)
describing six golden rules.

they're *really* good 
and i can still remember them by heart.

here they are:

## 1. no intro

people already clicked your video,
chop chop let's *go*!

straight to the point.

don't say "this video is gonna be about...",
"in this video i am going to...",
showcase something **upfront**.

the web is becoming hellish to navigate,
trust me, your viewers pondered that click.

## 2. good sound

people can forgive bad video.

people **never** forgive bad audio.
instant leave.

i film myself on the shitty laptop webcam,
but i bought a mic 
[(amazon basics first price)](https://www.amazon.fr/AmazonBasics-Mini-Microphone-Bureau-condensateur/dp/B076ZSR6BB).

and you better not do mumble rap.
speak loud and slow.

this is hard to do, so practice it
(noise-cancelling headphones can help).

## 3. "for you"

do videos that you yourself would like to watch.

this means: put **at least** a tiny amount of work into it.

please, just a little bit of work.

don't just record your game or your screen uninterrupted
like your channel is a cctv footage dump.

do something you give a fuck about.

## 4. music

music is a cheat code.

**always. add. music.**

for real! 0 downsides, always better.

just add music.

## 5. be yourself

behave normally.

speak like you would speak to your friends.

*(but still loud and slow, remember?)*

don't say stuff you wouldn't say in real life.

don't try to have a quirky internet persona.

**you already are interesting enough.**
like all human beings.
don't act it.

just be yourself.

## 6. editing

try to do some of it.

it shows you put work, as a sign of good faith.

moreover, any "hack" you would try to avoid editing
(like switching between tabs or windows)
will **only be worse.**

some cuts, some zooms, some text, some sound effects...

you know the drill.

*(alright, so this where i might be lacking.*
*i need a better software, i use clipchamp lol)*

## outro

no outro.
