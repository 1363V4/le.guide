i relapsed today.

i shall rewrite here the important words of visakan.

---

idk if i was *gravely* 'mentally' ill,
but i was down ominously bad
(false hope, impossible desires, intense grievance)
-- i feel like this has parallels with
being a heavy cigarette smoker then going off of them.
my favourite way of describing *that* is
"quitting punctuation"

---

i used to use cigarettes to punctuate my life.
started the day with them.
kept time with them.
regulated my moods with them.
finished meals with them.
socialized with them.
cigarettes kept my life in order.
they provided structure. rhythm.
i looked forward to the next one.

---

when i went off of them the punctuation marks fell out of my life
and all of a sudden i was falling spinning circling
everything is chaotic and makes no sense
where am i going who am i
even what is happening oh god
it's all too much and its everything at once
help help help

---

it took time for me to figure out new ways of arranging my life

without the punctuation marks i had grown accustomed to leaning on

turns out for example that you can use linebreaks as a form of punctuation

i had never considered that when all i knew was fullstops

---

similarly, the basic flavor of sanity seems disappointing,
mundane, boring, when you're used to excitement
in the form of intense mental activity

it's like going from walls of heavy distorted guitars and crashing cymbals
to a single solo piano.
at first it seems thin, weak, flat

---

but its just a different instrument,
a different aesthetic,
something you have to learn anew.
there's infinite nuance within that seemingly boring simplicity.
it just takes time and patience to allow yourself
to learn to appreciate it.
you have to relearn everything

---

appreciation is a skill that can be cultivated

you can learn to appreciate the elegance and simplicity
of having less anguished mental activity

this might sound weird to anyone who's never used that anguish as a comfort blanket

you can learn to relax in the emptiness
