i realize that when i listen to music,
or watch a video,
it's for *receiving.*

but it's hard when i create.
i spend more time choosing the songs than working.
and i focus on the songs.

i figured radio would help,
because you don't have to select the songs.
but i spend time selecting the radio, lol.
so many radios in the garden.

and it's ok.

i love receiving knowledge,
lettin it go through me.
but the world is gonna claim its due, right?

so yeah, background ambiance it is.

[a soft murmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/?lang=en)
is cool.

just typing background noise and rolling.

but i have to develop the reflex.
