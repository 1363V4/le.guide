journey as he said

inspired by game dev so why the fuck not

turbo seems bad finally
and webviews wrappers won't make the cut to the app store
allegedly

tell flask it is behind a proxy
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/deploying/proxy_fix/

web components
https://lit.dev/docs/
for the chessboard ?
https://data-star.dev/examples/web_component

write a flask wrapper
https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/blob/main/sdk/python/src/datastar_py/responses.py
i don't see why gunicorn wouldn't work

think ahead
