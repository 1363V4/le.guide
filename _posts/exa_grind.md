email engagement is not bad




1. **Reach and User Engagement**: 
The service gained my attention through various tweets and recommendations on Twitter from techies/tinkerers.
People I do not follow, so recommended by the algorithm.
The posts had 500-800 likes, which made me believe that it wasn't manipulated or paid ads. 
Additionally, the catchy name EXA made it memorable when I decided to explore further after minutes of doomscrolling.

2. **Landing Page**: 
The landing page was understandable (admittedly I had some context reading twitter posts).
The free 1000 requests per month offer was clear and fair. 
It felt low, giving the sense that they are somehow valuable, but also high, if they indeed are **that** valuable.
I logged in with Google as it reduces friction.

3. **User Interface and Experience**: 
The app itself is fantastic, and I must admit that I am part of the targeted demographic, not sure how a non-techie would react.
As someone who understands scripting, I found the Python code in the playground incredibly helpful.
The ability to modify the code as I clicked buttons and the inclusion of Python keywords enhanced my understanding of how different components work. 
The pip install feature and JSON output were impressive, but what truly stood out was the concise code snippet, conveying the idea that Exa is easy to implement.

4. **Additional Features**: 
The side panel provided essential information, with API keys being the first thing that grabbed my attention. 
It served as a reminder of the control and customization options available, similar to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
Additionally, having a documentation shortcut was convenient for quick reference.

5. **Closing Thoughts**: 
The problem this service addresses is real, search **is** broken. 
Based on my initial experience, the results seem promising. Conveys a sense of excitement.
As someone working in an intellectual profession, I frequently need to research articles and PDFs. 
I have a feeling I should try it more to better understand the strengths and limitations of Exa, so the free trial is great.
Pricing seems fair, given that I can adjust between 10 queries for important topics and less queries for simpler / more obvious subjects.

Would not hesitate to pay for it as good searching abilities are an important part of my work (staying informed, deep dives, technical projects).
Overall great potential, would invest, would recommend to friends, would build projects with it.

Here's the big issue you have imho:

- It is only by wandering a bit more that I discovered exa.ai / search, **after** the playground.
And here is the "normie" page!
Does it make sense that the "1000 requests/month" button gets you to the playground and "try exa" button gets you to search?
Not sure, unclear, kind of a dark pattern.

- So your core issue is that you have two target demographics.
And while I was really really hyped by the playground (hence the overwhelmingly positive review, but please make the urls in the response field clickable), and while the playground insta-sold me on exa...
It might deter non-techies, as said before.

- My thoughts on the search page:
Classy, but when you do minimal design, the devil is in the details.
"Prompt" field is too big: a Google search bar conveys the idea that you only have to type a few keyboards. Yours makes me feel like I have to write an essay to start searching.
"Try a prompt or paste a link": what's a prompt for non-techies? Has anyone ever tried searching a link?? The average Joe is going to type a few keywords in that box, don't try to scare them.
"Site filter" is useless: wikipedia should be an entry in "* More", twitter is already an entry in "*More", nobody cares about the nytimes + you already have a "News" tab.
And nobody ever "excludes" sites from search.
I mean, it can have some benefits, a good chunk of people know to add " reddit" at the end of their Google request to better their results (or " stackoverflow"), but as it is, it only muddens your interface.
"Companies" tab is weird, maybe due to the icon choice. Instead of getting a list of bleeding-edge companies working in a specific problem/field, I feel like I am browsing for annual reports or 10-K documents (boring).
"Search content by meaning" is a weird catchphrase. "Search what you mean" / "Search with AI" would do a better job.
Example fields are good enough.

Closing thoughts:
Even though the playground made me an instant believer and eager to build a web-app with exa,
I will use the search page for my day-to-day work. Less clutter, has all the buttons I need.
Would also be the page I will send a friend to recommend them Exa.

This is still a fantastic product and I still love it.
But hey, you might experience hypergrowth, and then it is like a rocket launch:
make sure your heat shield is really polished because a little too much friction will burn in the atmosphere.
