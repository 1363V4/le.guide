delaney talk:
generational index (4bit whenever you have to look up, look up to this)
sparse set = swapback with gen indexes
the queries themselves have this!
and by tracking them you get to optimize your queries!
need to dive into nats
minecraft works that way
dont use booleans! 
existential programming: read first three chapters
example: aoe has a lot of pathfindings
swapbacks alternatives: b trees, quad trees
disruptor pattern: ephermal stuff with a fixed size (very fast)
sparse set + disruptor = very fast
games are all about reusing buffers
for billions of particles: shader+ seed + time
relations? not a prob with generationa indexes - pgo: profile guided optimization
