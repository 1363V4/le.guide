this set is the set of all time.
no doubt.

i was diamond last set and was like
*for sure this is the set i go master*,
but i instead quit.

i was on a good run,
and had some fantastic moments.
let me say it again, this is the best set ever.
you're always garanteed to top 1
with a beating heart.

so why quit?

i got the switch for christmas.

and i got metroid prime 4.

and this was kind of my first love man.
the artistic part of a game.
letting the music play for minutes watching the title screen.

getting moved by the story.
oh, of course, riot games have a story,
it's just that you have to make it.
that's why streaming it is so popular,
every game feels like a new story being told.

but it can be exhausting.
and sometimes the story let you down.

and it's not **yours**.
you want to tell it, share it,
it's about you and what everyone else did.

i like stories i can take with me
like a tune i hum in my heart.

i resisted buying the switch for what,
5 years now? more?

i told myself *you need to work now!*,
but still spent hours in riot games.
hundreds of them.

i was locked in competition mode,
and competition got back to me.

i reached master in wild rift
for 8 consecutive seasons.

i 100% slay the spire.

i'm almost perfectionist ii in balatro.

a grind mindset.
it was fun!

but now it's time for something else.

*mission complete.*
