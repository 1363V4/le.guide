title: sam altman should wear lacoste
layout: post

l'histoire est nulle
faut refaire avec bah une vraie histoire quoi
avec le gamin qui doit fermer la gueule
et le croco qui finit par open source le médical
ou juste appeler à l'aide

did you know?

crocodiles have tremendous power to **close**
their jaws,
but very little to open it.

a kid putting its hands on both sides of a crocodile's jaw
would be enough to keep the beast tame.
heck, a rubber band would be enough.

oh, right, sam altman.

well, it was kind of a metaphor you see
(if you don't know what a metaphor is, ask chat gpt).
open ai is the crocodile. the markets are the rubber band.

open ai is opening its mouth wider and wider.
people are freaking out.
"it's gonna be awful when this thing bites"!
we're all doomed!
ze llm will eat ze world!

mouth opens 100 billions.
mouth opens 200 billions.
mouth wants to open a *billion trillion wide*.
out of natural instinct,
low-level predators roll on the floor and
feign death already.

and what is the crocodile doing with such a big mouth?
lots of noise, that's for sure.
lots of noise but no bite.

oh look!
apple chosed google!

oh look!
you're an endangered species now!

oh look!
here comes the investors with a rubber band!
