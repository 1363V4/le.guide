- the pain is due to tms, not to a structural abnormality.
- the direct reason for the pain is mild oxygen deprivation.
- tms is a harmless condition, caused by my repressed emotions.
- the principal emotion is my repressed anger.
- tms exists only to distract my attention from the emotions.
- since my back is basically normal there is nothing to fear.
- therefore, physical activity is not dangerous.
- and i must resume all normal physical activity.
- i will not be concerned or intimidated by the pain.
- i will shift my attention from the pain to emotional issues.
- i intend to be in control not my subconscious mind.
- i must think psychological at all times, not physical.
