yoons made a video
gave me confidence
i think it was six points
let's see if i rememeber them

1. no intro, people already clicked let's go
2. good sound, so good mic and loud speak
3. music is a cheat code, add it
4. have personality, behave normally
5. no outro

i guess the last one was try to edit at least a bit
not sure...
