in the night, in the night
we gave barely a fight
and all fell down,
we fell down.

when the blight, when the blight
hit with all of its might,
the world fell down,
all went down.

*when i see that booty, baby*
*weasel body's out of sight*
*wanna take a bite*
*got an appetite for all that fuzzy wuzzy lovin' yum*
*feelin' heat like mount st. helens, hun*
*i'ma sittin' duck who's been thunderstruck (baby)*
*gettin razzle dazzled by that furry butt (maybe)*
*back it up, back it up*

in the night, in the night
as we cowered in fright,
we all fell down,
**
i fell down
*weasel booty gives me joy*
